# SIR-Implementation

Implementation of SIR algorithm

This was created in order to get some insight to how the epidemic grows and behaves, 
with different values for the beta (contact exposure of disease) and gamma(healing period)

I also implemented a Ordinary Differential Equation to help me with the implementation.

I will be updating this with the equations that I used.
